## swiftype-dump

This is a work-in-progress project.

The goal of `swiftype-dump` is to produce a `.swiftinterface` file given a Mach-O as input.

Thanks to help from https://derekselander.github.io/dsdump/#swift and https://github.com/blacktop/ipsw/blob/adf12a3dc76dd61a6cca46658f7762b66db27daf/cmd/ipsw/cmd/swift_dump.go
